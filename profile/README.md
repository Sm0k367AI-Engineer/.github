Conclusion

Trading Strategy for BTCUSDT
We devised a detailed trading strategy for BTCUSDT perpetual contracts, focusing on conservative, moderate, and aggressive approaches based on the current market price, index price, mark price, and funding rate. We calculated Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) levels for each strategy to manage risk effectively while aiming for potential profit.
Key Points

Entry Price: Based on the current market price.
Strategies: Outlined conservative, moderate, and aggressive strategies with specific TP and SL levels.
Risk Management: Emphasized the importance of adjusting trading strategies based on real-time market analysis and personal risk tolerance.

Getting Started with UploadThing in Next.js
We explored integrating UploadThing into a Next.js application for handling file uploads efficiently. This included setting up the environment, creating a FileRouter, and generating UploadButton and UploadDropzone components for a seamless client experience.
Setup Steps

Install Packages: npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
Environment Variables: Securely store the UPLOADTHING_SECRET key.
FileRouter Creation: Define FileRoutes with specific permissions, file types, and callbacks.
Next.js API Route: Implement an API route to handle file uploads using the FileRouter.
Styling: Customize UploadThing components with Tailwind CSS.

Authentication and Environment Setup
We covered best practices for authenticating API requests using tokens and stressed the importance of storing tokens securely in environment variables or a .env file. This ensures that sensitive information remains secure and is not hard-coded into the application.
Authentication Highlights

Token Storage: Use of environment variables or a .env file for storing Replicate API tokens.
cURL Testing: Demonstrated how to test the setup using cURL and the Authorization: Bearer HTTP header.

API Reference and React Components
The API reference section provided insights into generating fully typesafe components bound to the file router type, enhancing the developer experience with UploadThing. We discussed generating UploadButton and UploadDropzone components, configuring them, and handling file inputs effectively.
Components Overview

UploadButton: A simple button component for uploading files.
UploadDropzone: A component for drag-and-drop file uploads.
Configuration Options: Detailed the props and configuration options available for customizing the components.

Conclusion
Throughout our journey, we've tackled various aspects of developing a full-stack application, from devising trading strategies and managing environmental variables to integrating third-party services for file uploads. This documentation serves as a testament to our collaborative learning and a reference guide for future development endeavors.
